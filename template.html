    <p>Hi mentor &amp; students,</p>

    <p>As you know, COPS IIT (BHU) has started a GSoC Mentorship program where all the Ex-GSoCers of IIT BHU have come
      together to mentor the students for GSoC â€˜22. We are thankful to <b>{{.Mentor.Name}}</b> (the mentor for this
      group) for
      agreeing to be a part of our GSoC mentorship program and giving his/her precious time to mentor the students.</p>

    <p>The following students are present in this group, and their details are as mentioned below:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name </th>
          <th>Email address </th>
          <th>Year </th>
          <th>Experience </th>
          <th>Contact </th>
          <th>Github Handle </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {{range .Mentees}}
        <tr>
          <td>{{.Name}}</td>
          <td><a href="mailto:{{.Email}}" target="_blank">{{.Email}}</a></td>
          <td>{{.Year}}</td>
          <td>{{.Experience}}</td>
          <td>{{.Contact}}</td>
          <td><a href="https://github.com/{{.Github}}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">{{.Github}}</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> </td>
          <td> </td>
          <td> </td>
          <td> </td>
        </tr>
        {{end}}
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>We are sending this email so that you can introduce yourselves to each other and figure out a communication
      platform where you all will be communicating with each other in the future. (Probably the mentor can introduce
      themselves first, followed by the students).</p>

    <p>We also have a slack workspace of IBGAA where all the mentors are already invited. You all are requested to
      register yourself on the IBGAA website before joining the workspace using this <a
        href="https://join.slack.com/t/iit-bhu-alumni/shared_invite/zt-11iekztk0-_94d80XZ2~djyLU7q7KTYg" target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer">link</a>.</p>

    <p>Lastly, we have created a document outlining the program structure, timeline, and standard operating procedures
      for GSoC 2022. Please make sure to read this document carefully: <a
